    <h1>About me</h1>
    <h2>Liam Arguedas</h2>
    <p>I have a passion for delving into intricate data sets to uncover valuable insights. With over 4 years of industry experience, I have honed my skills in Python, R, and SQL to effectively manipulate data and construct predictive models.
        Throughout my career, I have tackled various projects in the realms of Natural Language Processing/Natural Understanding (NLP/NU), Business Intelligence/Business Analytics (BI/BA), Time Series Forecasting, Recommender Systems, and other supervised/unsupervised learning problem domains. By leveraging these solutions and applications, I have assisted organizations in making data-driven decisions and enhancing their overall profitability.</p>
